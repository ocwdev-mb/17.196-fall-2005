Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

This seminar explores changes in the international economy and their effects on domestic politics, economy, and society. Some of the key issues that will be explored include:

*   Is globalization really a new phenomenon?
*   Is it irreversible?
*   What are effects on wages and inequality, on social safety nets, on production, and innovation?
*   How does it affect relations between developed countries and developing countries?
*   How does globalization affect democracy?

The seminar is open to undergraduates and graduate students. Some prior work in political science or economics is strongly recommended. For undergraduates there will be an additional one-section meeting (one hour) to be scheduled at the first meeting of the class. Graduate students will be expected to do most of the recommended as well as the assigned readings. The requirements for undergraduates and graduate students are:

1.  To complete each week's assigned reading before class;
2.  Two essays on assigned topics.

The papers require thinking about issues raised in readings and class discussion. They should be between 12 to 15 typed double-spaced pages. Graduate students who wish to write a major research paper instead of the two essays should meet during the first month of term with Suzanne Berger and discuss an outline of the research.
